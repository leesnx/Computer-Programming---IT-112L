Problem:
Create a program that will be used at the check-out counter of Aling Nena's Sari-Sari Store.
Follow the assumptions given in the following description of Aling Nenaâ€™s store.
The customers of Aling Nena's store always buy only one type of product, but they may buy one
or more pieces of the said product. For example, a customer may buy 12 pieces of eggs or 2
packs of milk.
Notes:
Depending on the customer, Aling Nena may decide to give the customer a discount, expressed
as an integer value from 1 to 100, which indicates the percentage deducted from the total amount
of the customer's purchase. For example, assuming that eggs cost P5.00 a piece, a dozen eggs
would cost a total of P60.00; if the customer is given a 10 percent discount, then the customer
will have to pay only P54.00 for one dozen of eggs. Customers who are not entitled to discounts
are given zero (0) percent discount. Aling Nena's customers always pay in cash, and the cash
amount tendered is always greater than or equal to the total purchase amount. Your program
must calculate the change to be given to the customer.
Sample run:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Sample Input:

Product: eggs
Quantity: 12
Unit Price: 5.00
Discount: 10
Cash Tendered: 100.00

Sample Output:

Total Purchase Amount: 60.00
Total Discount: 6.00
Amount To Be Paid: 54.00
Change: 46.00

2. Sample Input:

Product: milk
Quantity: 3
Unit Price: 18.75
Discount: 0
Cash Tendered: 60.00

Sample Output:

Total Purchase Amount: 56.25
Total Discount: 0.00
Amount To Be Paid: 56.25
Change: 3.75

3. Sample Input:

Product: sardines
Quantity: 2
Unit Price: 23.50
Discount: 25
Cash Tendered: 35.25

Sample Output:

Total Purchase Amount: 47.00
Total Discount: 11.75
Amount To Be Paid: 35.25
Change: 0.00
